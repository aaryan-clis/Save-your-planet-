     <h2>
        The environment is our natural foundation, and we have to take care of it. Our environment plays a massive role in the kind of person we grow up to be. There are a lot of valid reasons for which we need to save our environment. Our environment has suffered significant threats in the last few decades. The ever increasing vehicles and pollution have transformed our environment into a mass of smoky mess. Enormous corruption has almost stripped it of fresh air.

     <h2>A healthy environment has fresh and bacteria-free air and is not the breeding ground for diseases. To protect our environment, we need to know what we should defend. Humankind has advanced in many ways, but in our race, we have compromised our natural environment and become the most intelligent and technologically superior species on earth. Large areas of the forest have been cut down to provide residential places to humans. We have cut down trees at our will to make paper and furniture. Valuable timber and trees with medicinal properties have fallen prey to the slash and burn farming culture.</h2>
